        # takes a reference to a Python function or method. We call a function

        # this, we can change the text on the label by simply changing
        # self.hello_string. We'll also set a much larger font by using the font
        # argument, which takes a tuple in the format (font_name, font_size).
        #The wraplength argument specifies how wide the text can be before it
        # wraps to the next line.

        #In this case, we're adding our widgets using the grid() geometry
        # manager, rather than the pack() geometry manager we used before. As
        # the name implies, grid() allows us to position widgets on their
        # parent object using rows and columns, much like a spreadsheet or
        # HTML table. Our first three widgets are arranged across three
        # columns in row 0, while hello_label will be on the second row (row 1).
        # The sticky argument takes a cardinal direction (N, S, E, or Wâ€”you can
        # either use strings or the Tkinter constants), which specifies which side
        # of the cell the contents must stick to. You can add these together to
        # stick the widget to multiple sides; for example, by sticking the
        # name_entry widget to both the east and west sides, it will stretch to fill
        # the whole width of the column. The grid() call for hello_label uses the
        # columnspan argument. As you might expect, this causes the widget to
        # span three grid columns. Since our first row established three columns
        # for the grid layout, we need to span all three if we want this widget to
        # fill the width of the application. Finally, we'll finish the __init__()
        # method by adjusting the grid configuration:

        self.columnconfigure(1, weight=1) #Here, we're telling it to weight
        # column 1 (the second column) more than the others. By doing this, the
        # second column of the grid (where our entry lives) will expand horizontally and
        # squash surrounding columns to their minimum widths. There is also a rowconfigure()
        # method for making similar changes to grid rows.

            self.hello_string.set("Hello " + self.name.get())
        else:

        #To get the value of the text entry, we call the get() method of its
        # text variable. If this variable contains any characters (notice we
        # strip the white space), we'll set our hello text to greet the name
        # entered; otherwise, we'll just greet the whole world.
